Alma Common Software Community Branch RPM Repos for CentOS 7 (EL 7)
For now, only x86_64 is available, but, hopefully once the SRPMS are made available
ports can be created for aarch64, without cross compiling nightmares =D

# Update OS
yum -y update
#Epel repo, centos-release-scl and apache-maven-fedora repo must be installed before:
curl https://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/dchen/apache-maven/epel-apache-maven.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/epel-apache-maven.repo
yum -y install epel-release centos-release-scl
#Acs cb and Extprod repo
curl http://repo.csrg.cl/acs-cb.repo -o /etc/yum.repos.d/acs-cb.repo
yum install -y gcc
yum install -y ACS-ExtProds 
# Currently gcc is not getting installed even when declared as a requirement
# To load env vars youcan do "source ~/.bashrc" or logout and logi" or logout and login

Places to look for packages:
SRPMS: 
  - http://fedora.gtdinternet.com/releases/{Fedora Version}/Everything/source/SRPMS/
  - https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/23/Server/source/SRPMS/
x86_64: 
  - http://ftp.inf.utfsm.cl/fedora/linux/releases/{Fedora Version}/Everything/x86_64/os/Packages/
  - http://ftp.inf.utfsm.cl/fedora/linux/updates/{Fedora Version}/x86_64/
aarch64:
  - http://mirror.chpc.utah.edu/pub/fedora-secondary/updates/{Fedora Version}/aarch64/
  - http://mirror.chpc.utah.edu/pub/fedora-secondary/releases/{Fedora Version}/Everything/aarch64/os/Packages/

Also rpmfind.net and OpenSuse pages are useful.
